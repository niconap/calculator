# Calculator

_This is a revisit of the [calculator project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator)
from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I revisited this
project to create a tidier solution with higher quality code._

### Usage

To use the calculator app, install the dependencies first:

```bash
$ npm install
```

After this has been finished, use the following command to run the app:

```bash
$ npm start
```

The app should automatically open in your browser. If it does not, you can find
it at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

### Credits

For this project, the [CSS reset sheet](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)
by Josh W. Comeau was used.
